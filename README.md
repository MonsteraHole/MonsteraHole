# Hi there 👋

I’m a data analyst who enjoys turning messy datasets into clear insights, building clean SQL pipelines, and asking why the numbers are the way they dare. From sports stats to agriculture analytics, I like to ask questions and learn how industries work as a whole.
I work mostly with sports 🏀⚾ and public data 🌍

# 📊 What you’ll find here: 
End-to-end data analysis projects using SQL, Excel, PostgreSQL, and PowerBI tools, from data cleaning and aggregation to visualization and storytelling. I focus on business insights, regression analysis, and building pipelines that make messy data usable.

# ⚡ Fun fact:

Big fan of F1 🏎️ and baseball ⚾
